# Research

This page features research using the Mock Social Media Website tool for you to read, cite, and understand the capabilities of the tool from!

**If you are conducting research using the tool, even if it is in an early stage, please [e-mail Arvin](mailto:arvin.jagayat@ryerson.ca) to let him know!**

This not only helps give your research visibility, but helps demonstrate the value of this tool to others, such as funding agencies and hiring committees; which is particularly invaluable to a PhD student like Arvin Jagayat who is looking to get an academic position!
