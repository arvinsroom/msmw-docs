# People

This would not have been possible without the many people and organizations that, and is a result of years of collaboration with and feedback from many people and organizations. This page highlights a few of the most important people to this project.

## Arvin Jagayat

[Arvin Jagayat](https://sites.psychlabs.ryerson.ca/spplab/portfolio/arvin-jagayat/) is a PhD student working with Dr. Choma. The original version of this tool was developed for a study in his SSHRC-funded dissertation research, which focuses on developing ways to disincentivize the spread of misinformation. The Mock Social Media Website Project was spun out of the idea of making the website useful for more than just the needs and study design of his dissertation. Arvin is the lead of the project and involved in every capacity.

## Gurkaran Boparai

[Gurkaran Boparai](https://github.com/gs3bopar) is a recent graduate of the University of Waterloo's Bachelors in Computer Science program. Gurkaran was the main fullstack developer behind the current version of the tool.

## Carson Pun

[Carson Pun](https://www.ryerson.ca/psychology/about-us/our-people/administrative-staff/carson-pun/) is the Research Operations Administrator and IT Specialist in the Psychology Department at Ryerson University. Carson was instrumental to helping structure and develop the prototype version of the tool, and giving feedback throughout the development process.

## Other key partners
