![Wordmark for the Mock Social Media Website Tool](/img/logo-wordmark.jpg)

It has been a long time coming, but we can finally share that the Mock Social Media Website tool will be made available for researchers on June 21st, 2021! The Github links to the code on this site will not work until then, but I will do another blog post when it is live.

This website is the home for everything related to the tool...

<!--truncate-->

* Detailed written and video guides on how to design, customize, and run your studies using the tool
* Best research practices, recommendations, and resources from previous studies which have used the tool
* Updates on the development of the tool

This blog will be updated with release notes and other major news about the tool, but it is probably easier for most to either [follow Arvin on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/rvinsroom) or join the mailing list by [sending Arvin an e-mail](mailto:arvin.jagayat@ryerson.ca) to stay in the loop.

It has taken a lot of work to get this tool out there, so we're super excited to see what researchers are able to investigate using it!
