# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do you have examples of materials that I can use or modify when putting together an ethics application to submit to my IRB/REB?**
> Yes! You can check out [the OSF project page](https://osf.io/m2xd8/files/) to find them. Please note that the files here were used for a pre-release version of the tool, so some things may differ from the version available now.

**Can you make this tool into an iOS/Android app or a Progressive Web Application?**
> We considered going this direction at the start of the development and decided against it because of the additional start-up costs, technical expertise & time investment required of the researchers setting up the studies, and costs associated with long-term support of the tool for little additional convenience and little-to-no functional advantages. iOS and Android platforms continually change from version-to-version which could have an app working one day and not the next, whereas web standards are universally shared and are more reliably backwards-compatible.

**Can I run studies that facilitate live interactions between participants in the social media environment? Or is your tool for collecting actual, observational data from real social media websites?**
> No, our tool is not intended nor able to address these types of research designs.

**Your tool doesn't suit my specific research needs. Are there any alternatives that might better fit my research question?**
> Yes! Below is a list of other social media simulation research tools and/or related interventions which I am aware of and might be a better fit to you.

* [Social Media TestDrive](https://socialmediatestdrive.org/)
