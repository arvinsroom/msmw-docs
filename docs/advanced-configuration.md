## Optional: Visual Studio Code Extensions

One of the benefits of using Visual Studio Code is access to many extensions that can make code editing more user-friendly and less error-prone.

When you have Visual Studio Code open, you can install extensions by selecting the icon with blocks on the right panel and searching for the names of extensions.

Here are a few that I have found [recommended elsewhere](https://youtu.be/LdF2RcelRg0) and personally found useful:

* **Auto Rename Tag** - Automatically renames the closing tag if you rename the opening tag in HTML, or vice versa.
* **Bracket Pair Colorizer** - Colour-codes brackets so you can more easily see which opening and closing brackets are paired and whether you are missing a bracket anywhere.
* **Code Spell Checker** - Spell checks your use of common functions and tags, which can break the website if spelled incorrectly.
* **HTML CSS Support** - Gives autocomplete suggestions based upon existing classes and id values in your code, which is helpful for avoiding spelling errors.
* **indent-rainbow** - Helps you see what code is indented at what level by adding a rainbow to the indented space. Useful for cases where there are multiple instances of nested code and it is hard to visually determine what level something is nested at.
* **Prettier - Code formatter** - Every time you save your files, it cleans up the document to be more readable in various ways (e.g. aligns indents to their appropriate level for nested code).
